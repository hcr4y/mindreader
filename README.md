# Mind Reader

This is a mini mind reader game. A coin is flipped. While predictions are made, minds are read.

The user needs to pick either heads or tails. Before the user makes his/her pick, the program will make a prediction as to whether the user is going to pick heads or tails.

If the program correctly predicted the users pick, it earns a point. Otherwise, if the program predicts incorrectly, the player will get a point. Whoever obtains 25 points first wins. Sneak peak: the program likes to win.

This program is the solution to a problem presented to me in DSA.
